**1.	Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.**

	The over of this project was to figure out the best time of year and price range to launch a Kickstarter campaign that would have the highest likely hood of success.
---
**2. Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.**

	To analyze the data I first broke it down into basic parts so it could be precisely filtered. For example I translated the launch date code into a readable format using =(((XX/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1). Some issues that can come to light is that the data doesn’t do full dive into why something hit its goal or missed. Did the successful projects use more social media than the failed ones, etc.

**3.Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.**

   -**What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?**
   
   -Best time to launch is May/June and a play is more likely to succeed than fail.
     
-**What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

   -The lower the play’s goal the better chance of success, and plays do not get canceled they just succeed or fail. 
   
-**What are some limitations of this dataset?**

  -Hard to tell what made a kickstarter reach its goal vs fail.
  
-**What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**

  -We can make a chart showing the % of success of Kickstarters based on donation size. Chart showing the success of staff picks.
